# SpectralClustering

This repo contains the codes, images, report and slides for the project of the course - `MTH552A: Statistical & AI Techniques in Data Mining` at IIT Kanpur during the academic year 2022-2023.

## Project Title
`Spectral Clustering:  Theory and Applications`

## Abstract
> In this report, we present a class of  popular clustering algorithms called Spectral Clustering algorithms. We introduce graph theoretic notations required to understand the report. We discuss similarity graphs and graph Laplacians, along with their important properties. Three popular clustering algorithms are presented. Choice of optimal number of clusters, similarity functions, similarity  graphs and graph Laplacians are also discussed. We then present Spectral clustering through different looking glasses. Finally, we apply Spectral clustering to simulated and real life datasets. This report is primarily based on [1].
